export const fit4MeDescription =
`
Fit4Me is an end-to-end Android fitness platform currently under development as a collaborative team project. 
Built with Jetpack Compose and Kotlin on the client side and powered by a Node.js + Express backend with 
PostgreSQL, it delivers personalized workout programs, real-time messaging, session tracking, and smart 
partner matching based on user goals, schedules, and experience levels. The system leverages RESTful APIs 
for data operations and WebSocket channels for live interaction, ensuring a responsive, seamless user 
experience. While still in progress, Fit4Me is designed to provide a scalable, user-focused fitness 
solution that balances sleek UI/UX with strong backend performance.

// Crop Yield
export const cropTitle = "Crop Yield Prediction & Risk Mitigation using Deep Learning";
export const cropDescription =
`
Developed a machine learning framework to predict crop yields and assess agricultural risk using 
real-world data on rainfall, temperature, pesticide use, and crop type. Utilized Random Forest and 
Lasso Regression for feature selection and interpretable yield prediction, then engineered temporal 
features and implemented an LSTM model for sequential analysis. Built a dynamic risk scoring system 
to help optimize resource allocation and provide actionable insights for farmers. 
This group project demonstrated the value of predictive analytics for sustainable, 
data-driven decision-making in agriculture.
